# Telegram Minecraft Bot
A simple bot to ping Minecraft servers from Telegram to get their player count and MOTD. Made as a small project to familiarise myself with Python and the python-telegram-bot Telegram bot API wrapper.

# Usage
If you want to run this bot yourself, first install the requirements as listed in `requirements.txt`. Then follow the instructions [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) to get an API key and put it in the `minecraftsettings.yml` file. Then just run the Python file as normal.

If you want to use this bot without hosting it, it is live [here](http://www.telegram.me/mcpingbot).
